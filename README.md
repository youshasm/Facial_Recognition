- **Tasks:** 8-class emotion classification + valence/arousal regression
- **Training Time:** ~90 minutes total for both models

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement
Facial expression recognition is a crucial component of human-computer interaction and emotion AI systems. This project addresses three interconnected tasks:

1. **Emotion Classification**: Categorizing facial expressions into 8 classes (Neutral, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Fear, Disgust, Anger, Contempt)
2. **Valence Prediction**: Predicting emotional positivity/negativity on a scale from -1 to +1
3. **Arousal Prediction**: Predicting emotional activation/excitement level from -1 to +1

### 1.2 Objectives
- Implement multi-task learning for simultaneous emotion recognition and dimensional emotion prediction
- Compare ResNet50 and EfficientNetB1 architectures
- Achieve high accuracy across all three prediction tasks
- Optimize training efficiency while maintaining performance

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Dataset
- **Source:** AffectNet-style facial expression dataset
- **Images:** 3,999 total images (224x224 RGB)
- **Annotations:** .npy files containing expression labels, valence, and arousal values
- **Sample Size:** 1000 images selected for training efficiency
- **Split:** 80% training (800), 20% validation (200)

### Dataset Structure
```
Dataset/
├── images/           # 224x224 RGB facial images
└── annotations/      # .npy files with labels and coordinates
    ├── {id}_exp.npy  # Expression labels (0-7)
    ├── {id}_val.npy  # Valence values [-1, +1]
    ├── {id}_aro.npy  # Arousal values [-1, +1]
    └── {id}_lnd.npy  # 68 facial landmark points
```

### Emotion Categories
- **0**: Neutral
- **1**: Happy
- **2**: Sad
- **3**: Surprise
- **4**: Fear
- **5**: Disgust
- **6**: Anger
- **7**: Contempt

### Dimensional Affect
- **Valence**: Continuous values from -1 (negative/unpleasant) to +1 (positive/pleasant)
- **Arousal**: Continuous values from -1 (tired/calm) to +1 (active/excited)

### 2.2 Data Preprocessing and Augmentation

#### Base Preprocessing:
- Image resizing to 224x224 pixels
- RGB color space conversion
- Normalization to [0, 1] range
- Stratified splitting to maintain class distribution

#### Data Augmentation Pipeline:
To improve model generalization and reduce overfitting, we implemented a comprehensive data augmentation strategy:

- **Random Rotation**: ±15 degrees
- **Random Zoom**: ±10% scaling
- **Random Translation**: ±10% horizontal and vertical shifts
- **Horizontal Flip**: 50% probability
- **Brightness Adjustment**: ±10% variation
- **Contrast Adjustment**: ±10% variation

The augmentation pipeline increased the effective dataset size from 800 to ~4,000 training samples, significantly improving model robustness and validation performance.
